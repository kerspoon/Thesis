	use in teaching power system reliability evaluation. It includes
	all the main elements found in practical systems. However, it is
	sufficiently small that students can analyze it using hand calculations
	and hence fully understand reliability models and evaluations techniques.
	All the data needed to perform basic reliability analyses are included
	in this work. It also contains the basic results for a range of case
	studies and alternative design/operating configurations },

  year = {1993},
  volume = {8},

  pages = {1239-1245},
  month = {Jul},
  abstract = {A time sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach to reliability assessment
	of substations and switching stations is presented. The technique
	is illustrated by application to a practical configuration and is
	used to evaluate the station reliability indices which are then compared
	with those obtained using an analytical method. The study results
	show that the simulation method can provide acceptable indices. The
	simulation approach is also used to perform station sensitivity analysis
	by varying selected station component parameters. This type of analysis
	can play an important role in improving power system reliability,
	and is essential and necessary in the selection of critical components.
	The Monte Carlo procedure is utilized to develop probability distributions
	associated with the station reliability indices. It is shown how
	the simulation method can provide additional indices which cannot
	easily be obtained using an analytical method},

  title = {Failure rate modeling using equipment inspection data},
  year = {2004},
  pages = { 693-700 Vol.1},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {System reliability models typically use average equipment failure
	rates. Even if these models are calibrated based on historical reliability
	indices, all like components within a calibrated region remain homogeneous.
	This paper presents a new method of customizing failure rates using
	equipment inspection data. This allows available inspection information
	to be reflected in system models, and allows for calibration based
	on interruption distributions rather than mean values. The paper
	begins by presenting a method to map equipment inspection data to
	a normalized condition score, and suggests a formula to convert this
	score into failure probability. The paper concludes by applying this
	methodology to a test system based on an actual distribution system,
	and shows that the incorporation of condition data leads to richer
	reliability models.},
