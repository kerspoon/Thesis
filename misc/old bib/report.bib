	more cost effective than the techniques available hitherto. First,
	a prescheduling of the generating units using the ANN is presented.
	Since the solution attained via the ANN may not be feasible for the
	entire scheduling period, the GA (or the GA with a PL) is subsequently
	employed to adjust the prescheduling. To take load-forecast uncertainty
	into account and to make the schedule feasible and cost effective,
	a typical ±5% load forecast error is incorporated into the ANN training
	data. The proposed techniques are shown to be efficient and flexible
	based on the simulations performed on the IEEE reliability test systems.
	In addition, the proposed hybrid techniques are shown to have higher
	potential to enhance performance and expedite the solution, overcoming

	wind turbines are connected through two feeders to the 10kV busbar
	in a 50/10kV substation. The simulation model, implemented in the

	first place to simulate the behaviour of the wind farm during normal

	almost identical wind turbine models, where electric, mechanic and
	aerodynamic aspects are included, and a model for the wind speed.
	The described model can be used for assessment of power quality,
	control strategies and behaviour in the event of grid faults. In
	this paper, the ability of the model to predict power quality is
	investigated. The simulations are used to compute power quality characteristics
	of a wind turbine, i.e. maximum power, reactive power consumption
	and flicker emission. The applied computation methods are reflecting

  abstract = {Categorizes three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis models, along
	with the basic transient reactance model. Discusses some of the assumptions
	made in using various models and presents the fundamental equations
	and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing. Covers, generally,
	the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two
	basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance
	nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances,
	where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications
	of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner
	in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both
	in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance
	stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions
	that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite
	elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating
	values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator
	terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination
	is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and
	excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors
	are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another
	for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions
	for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities
	are included.},

	Voltage stability of the regional network may be a main limitation
	with respect to maximum rating and operation of the wind power plant
	Technical constraints in relation to wind power integration in weak
	grids may in general be associated with limited thermal capacity
	in parts of the grid and/or the adverse effect wind power can have
	on voltage quality and stability. In certain situations, however,
	local constraints regarding development of new transmission lines
	or upgrading of existing lines can make it interesting to utilise
	the existing lines to a level which in worst case may imply operation
	beyond the normal technical constraints of the system. In this work,
	challenges and opportunities arising from situations as described
	above are analysed, and viable measures to enable secure and acceptable
	operation of large wind farms in remote areas close to the thermal
	capacity and stability limits of the power system, are pointed out.

	Small wind turbines, which have many applications ranging from off-grid

	systems while offering substantial environmental advantages. The
	barriers to increased wind deployment are limited. Siting is not
	too difficult, particularly in the areas of the Great Plains where

	barrier is transmission simply because the wind resource is typically
	found at a distance from load centers. But states like Texas have
	helped facilitate wind development through policy decisions that
	ensure that the transmission system does not discriminate against
	wind because it is a variable resource. Perhaps the greatest current
	barrier facing wind energy technology is an information barrier:
	the fact that so many key decision makers-electric industry, financial
	community, and public policymakers-have not kept up with wind power's
	enormous progress over the last decade. But, as wind continues to
	double in global capacity every three years, that problem appears

  abstract = { Issues regarding steady state power system characteristics when planning
	large wind farms are investigated. Studies of a specific grid have
	been performed. A method for finding the maximum wind farm size at
	a given site is presented. The investigations show that the maximum
	wind farm capacity is highly dependent on the electrical configuration
	at the individual windmills. Reactive compensation increases the
	allowed capacity when using induction generators. Variable speed
	generators have the best electrical characteristics and give the
	potential of increasing the maximum wind farm capacity compared to
	induction generators. Losses in the internal wind farm grid and the
	external grid are also affected by the electrical configuration as
	well as the size of the wind farm. A configuration with induction
	generators and no reactive compensation gives increased losses both
	in the internal and external grid. Utilizing the grid to the maximum
	will also increase the losses.},
