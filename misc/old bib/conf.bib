  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for transient stability analysis
	in terms of measuring critical clearing time using grid-computing
	technology. Grid computing is a highly developed system for jointly
	solving collaborative complex problems; those are required to solve
	in limited time and therefore they need high performance computing.
	Probabilistic transient stability analysis is one such application,
	which requires a lot of computation for accurate results. This paper
	presents the grid computing based approach for this purpose, which
	is able to measure the critical clearing time through time domain
	simulation by using this method. A prototype system is developed
	in our research lab in order to deploy this technique. Experiments
	are performed on the prototype grid for probabilistic transient stability
	analysis on New England 39 bus test system. Results show that this
	method has capability of providing accurate results with better performance.},

	in this paper. The probability of steady state stability is relatively
	easier to determine because of the linearization of the system equations.
	The probability of transient stability, on the other hand, is much
	more difficult to obtain analytically because of the nonlinear transformations
	required. However, a Monte Carlo simulation method to determine transient

	various forms of system protection scheme (SPS) have been designed

	is to ensure that the system will fit with the reliability requirement
	specification in terms of dependability, and security. After major
	changes in system operating practices, or physical changes of the
	protected system, a refinement of the SPS decision process may be
	required. This paper uses a currently operational SPS as an example
	to demonstrate a refinement study. By incorporating an interval theory,
	a risk reduction worth importance concept, and a probabilistic risk-based
	index, the proposed procedure conducts parameter uncertainty analysis,
	identifies critical factors in the reliability model, performs risk
	assessments, and determines a better option for the refinement of

  abstract = {Although penetration of wind generation may displace a significant
	amount of energy produced by large conventional plant, there are
	issues associated with the extent to which wind generation will be
	able to replace the capacity and flexibility of conventional generating
	plant. This is important since wind power is variable, so it will
	be necessary to retain a significant proportion of conventional plant
	to ensure security of supply especially under conditions of high
	demand and low wind. Hence, the capacity value of wind generation
	will be limited as it will not be possible to displace conventional
	generation capacity on a #megawatt##for##megawatt# basis. Wind power
	is variable and not easy to predict, hence various forms of additional
	reserves will be needed to maintain the balance between supply and
	demand at all times. Additionally, if the majority of wind generation
	plant is located in Scotland and the North of England, reinforcement
	of the transmission network will be needed to accommodate the increases
	in the north-south flow of electricity. In this paper an assessment
	of the costs and benefits of wind generation on the UK electricity
	system is carried out, assuming different levels of wind power capacity.
	Overall, it is concluded that the system will be able to accommodate
	significant increases in wind power generation with relatively small

	of a power system. The simulation time is in the order of years in
	which the occurrence of disturbances and the subsequent protective
	action are considered to be stochastic processes. The objective is
	to obtain a probabilistic measure of transient stability for a power
	system instead of just its particular response to an individual disturbance.
	The latter is the usual output of deterministic transient stability
	programs that are used for present day worst case analysis. A probabilistic
	analysis is needed if such worst case design criteria is to be replaced
	by (probabilistic) reliability criteria. This paper describes a computer
	program that has been developed for such a Monte Carlo simulation
	and presents some results of its application to representative systems.},

  abstract = {It is shown how to obtain the probability of transient instability
	and how the different types of uncertainty can be included. An evaluation
	is made of the severity or consequences of the loss of a generator
	caused by an out of step condition. While calculating the probability,
	the transient stability performance of the system needs to be quantified
	for several fault location and fault types. For this purpose the
	transient stability index (TSI) is used. This index is based on the
	transient energy components calculated at each step of a time domain
	simulation. It allows a fast and accurate measurement of the degree
	of stability of the system facing a fault. One way to present the
	results is to plot the risk as a function of a single operating parameter.
	Another type of graph is the risk equivalent of the traditional it
	nomograms: instead of presenting the N-1 security boundaries, it
	shows contours of equal risk. Both type of plots must be updated
	when operating conditions change. A large number of risk values are
	required in real time to update the plots. As a result of the numerous
	time domain simulations, the calculation process becomes very heavy.
	To speed up the process, a neural network has been trained to predict
	the stability index of the system given a fault of a certain type
	at a certain location under the current operating conditions. This
	neural network is used to replace the slower time-domain simulation.
	To illustrate the usefulness of risk-based transient assessment,
	a few applications are presented. Several risk plots are displayed
	as well as equal-risk contour plots obtained with the NN},
