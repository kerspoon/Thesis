stability constrainded opf
63 TRANSIENT STABILITY ASSESSMENT

SCOPF - stability constrained (abstract) later called security constrained (P35). 
contingency constrained opf
OPF definition see weedy or wood \& wollenburg
3.2.1 definition of economic dispatch; - use the equations as well.
constraints: network:- generation - demand - loss = 0 
constraints: engineering:- generating limits (P and Q) voltage limits, transformer tap positions, line limits (either as current or MVA - determined by thermal rating and weather forecast), spinning reserve limit. 

opf is nonlinera, non-convex, large-scele static optimisation problem with both continious and discrete control variables. 

Techniques: (p41)
  nonlinear programming
  linear programming 
  interior point methods
  nondeterministic searching methods such a GA 

stability constrained opf is a member of secuity constrained opf family

why is stability constrained opf needed
why isn't is used now 

dynamic simulation
----

mathamticallay, the transient stability of a power system could be characterized by the solution of a set of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations the represent the dynamics of system components and the relationshop of voltages and currents of the transmission network. 

can be solved many ways; transient energy function and time domain simulation are two such methods.

how do you get the secuirty from the output? look at rotor angles and voltage etc... 

sensitivity analysis: how a change in one thing affects everything else. works best in a linear region

Modified load flow
----

what is load flow, how does it work, what results can you get.
what is OPF, how does it work
why do I need to modify the load flow (fix_mismatch)

When an imbalance occurs in a power system it has a transient that effects the entire system. Because a load flow cannot model this transient one bus is assumed to cope withall the changes. This is the slack bus. But in a larg
