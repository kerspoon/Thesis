	in terms of measuring critical clearing time using grid-computing
	technology. Grid computing is a highly developed system for jointly
	solving collaborative complex problems; those are required to solve
	in limited time and therefore they need high performance computing.
	Probabilistic transient stability analysis is one such application,
	which requires a lot of computation for accurate results. This paper
	presents the grid computing based approach for this purpose, which
	is able to measure the critical clearing time through time domain
	simulation by using this method. A prototype system is developed
	in our research lab in order to deploy this technique. Experiments
	are performed on the prototype grid for probabilistic transient stability
	analysis on New England 39 bus test system. Results show that this
	method has capability of providing accurate results with better performance.},

  abstract = {Many physical problems are most naturally described by systems of
	differential and algebraic equations. This book describes some of
	the places where differential-algebraic equations (DAE's) occur.
	The basic mathematical theory for these equations is developed and
	numerical methods are presented and analyzed. Examples drawn from
	a variety of applications are used to motivate and illustrate the
	concepts and techniques. This classic edition, originally published
	in 1989, is the only general DAE book available. It not only develops
	guidelines for choosing different numerical methods, it is the first
	book to discuss DAE codes, including the popular DASSL code. An extensive
	discussion of backward differentiation formulas details why they
	have emerged as the most popular and best understood class of linear
	multistep methods for general DAE's. New to this edition is a chapter
	that brings the discussion of DAE software up to date.},

	wind turbines are connected through two feeders to the 10kV busbar
	in a 50/10kV substation. The simulation model, implemented in the

	almost identical wind turbine models, where electric, mechanic and
	aerodynamic aspects are included, and a model for the wind speed.
	The described model can be used for assessment of power quality,
	control strategies and behaviour in the event of grid faults. In
	this paper, the ability of the model to predict power quality is
	investigated. The simulations are used to compute power quality characteristics

	assessment (PRA) for large interconnected power systems. It takes
	a large number of contingency load flow simulations and combine them
	with a practical method of characterizing the effect of the availabilities
	of generators, lines and transformers for computing meaningful probabilistic
	reliability indices (PRI). The method was demonstrated on the US
	Eastern interconnection and has been applied by several utilities
	belonging to the EPRI PRA user group. The ability of the method to
	provide insights on root causes, weak points and regional causes
	and effects was shown. Results would also be useful for developing
	effective remedial actions or investment options. The reliability
	indices could be used for measuring or monitoring bottlenecks, if
	an online computation of these indices is implemented. They can also
	be used as one of several performance indices for transmission investment
	decisions.},

  abstract = {Although penetration of wind generation may displace a significant
	amount of energy produced by large conventional plant, there are
	issues associated with the extent to which wind generation will be
	able to replace the capacity and flexibility of conventional generating
	plant. This is important since wind power is variable, so it will
	be necessary to retain a significant proportion of conventional plant
	to ensure security of supply especially under conditions of high
	demand and low wind. Hence, the capacity value of wind generation
	will be limited as it will not be possible to displace conventional
	generation capacity on a #megawatt##for##megawatt# basis. Wind power
	is variable and not easy to predict, hence various forms of additional
	reserves will be needed to maintain the balance between supply and
	demand at all times. Additionally, if the majority of wind generation
	plant is located in Scotland and the North of England, reinforcement
	of the transmission network will be needed to accommodate the increases
	in the north-south flow of electricity. In this paper an assessment
	of the costs and benefits of wind generation on the UK electricity
	system is carried out, assuming different levels of wind power capacity.
	Overall, it is concluded that the system will be able to accommodate
	significant increases in wind power generation with relatively small
	increases in overall costs of supply, about 5% of the current domestic
	electricity price in case of 20% energy produced by wind power.},

	found at a distance from load centers. But states like Texas have
	helped facilitate wind development through policy decisions that
	ensure that the transmission system does not discriminate against
	wind because it is a variable resource. Perhaps the greatest current

	the fact that so many key decision makers-electric industry, financial

	and how the different types of uncertainty can be included. An evaluation
	is made of the severity or consequences of the loss of a generator
	caused by an out of step condition. While calculating the probability,
	the transient stability performance of the system needs to be quantified
	for several fault location and fault types. For this purpose the
	transient stability index (TSI) is used. This index is based on the
	transient energy components calculated at each step of a time domain
	simulation. It allows a fast and accurate measurement of the degree
	of stability of the system facing a fault. One way to present the
	results is to plot the risk as a function of a single operating parameter.
	Another type of graph is the risk equivalent of the traditional it
	nomograms: instead of presenting the N-1 security boundaries, it
	shows contours of equal risk. Both type of plots must be updated
	when operating conditions change. A large number of risk values are
	required in real time to update the plots. As a result of the numerous
	time domain simulations, the calculation process becomes very heavy.
	To speed up the process, a neural network has been trained to predict
	the stability index of the system given a fault of a certain type
	at a certain location under the current operating conditions. This
	neural network is used to replace the slower time-domain simulation.
	To illustrate the usefulness of risk-based transient assessment,
	a few applications are presented. Several risk plots are displayed
	as well as equal-risk contour plots obtained with the NN},
